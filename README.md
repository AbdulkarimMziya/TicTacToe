## 💡 Concepts Demonstrated

This project showcases several key programming concepts and design principles:

- **JavaScript Modules (IIFEs):** Encapsulates logic in self-contained modules like `Game`, `GameBoardModule`, and `displayController`.
- **Factory Functions:** Used for creating player objects with properties like name and symbol.
- **Event Handling:** Listens for DOM events such as button clicks and cell selections.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically generates and updates game board UI based on the game state.
- **State Management:** Maintains game state (board values, player turns, win/tie logic) across interactions.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Logic is split between game mechanics, UI rendering, and user input handling.
- **Responsive Feedback:** Displays real-time messages for game status using a dedicated `displayController`.
